    <h1>Hello, world!!</h1>
    <p>Hello, I’m Nico, a product and UX designer, and collaboration enthusiast believing in the creative formula of 1 + 1 = 3.</p>
    <p>I facilitate a collaborative design practice to make solution ideas tangible and to create alignment around the same goal. 
      I use storytelling and prototyping to translate business and user needs into easy-to-use functiality, 
      and run experiments to drive an evidence-based decision making process. </p>
<p>Work samples are the decentralized finance app Centrifuge Pools, Appway Studio’s Package export, or Foobar. ¶</p>
